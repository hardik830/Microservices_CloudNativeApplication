##we can define any number of services inside this services block
##then give service name
##then give the image name for that service try cover the image name in double quotes so that
##it should be clear to docker compose

##          since you are using the same network in all three microservice
##    - you have to invoke you networks with same name that you define in all microservices
##driver: "bridge" is mention to create a bridge network with same name eazybank
#networks:
#    eazybank:
